# The Process
This time around I learned from my previous mistakes on project 1. I actually spent more time planning each step out and it was off to the races.Luckily the front end was similar to project 1, so I was able to recycle quite a bit of code. I added a few new forms and event listeners nothing too complicated, there was one day I spent a lot of time trying to figure out why my deployed app wasn't connecting to my back end through github. Too my surprise github was actually experiencing problems of their own which as a result affecting my client from connecting to the back end. Once their problem was fixed, so was mine and my front and back end were communicating just fine. On em major thing I decided to do this time around was focus on the styling asspect of my application and as a result I wasn't hitting MVP. So during the final few days I took out all the css and focused on MVP. With the remaining time I did what I could to make the layout look decent. By no means is this a finished product, I'm going to continue to wok i=on this until I'm personally satisfied. There are a lot more features I would like to add in later vefrsions.
